@Setup ReactJs

1. Intro
> npx create-react-app frontend
- clear unnecessary files / comments
inside frontend folder:
    > npm i react-router-dom

2. Make pages folder in src and make different pages
3. Use react-router-dom in App.js to route the pages
4. Navigation bar component will be same for all pages -> make it inside src/components/shared folder
5. Include the gooogle font links in public/index.html and icons/images in public/images
6. NOTE:- - the App.css will be applied to all components, eg. if Navigation.jsx has a class container, then App.css's container css will be applied there too
          - .module.css will only be applied to parent components & not the child ones.. for child use inline css
7. Things which are being re-used will go in the components folder .. like the Card with the heading consisting of an emoji and a line for heading
8. use children prop in components to get the contents written inside components when they are used
9. for smooth hover transitions etc, use transition property
10. since Button is being used as a component, we can't directly use onclick listener, therefore pass a function as a prop to Button component & handle it there
11. for registration going to next steps, we will use a hashMap in Register.jsx and useState()
